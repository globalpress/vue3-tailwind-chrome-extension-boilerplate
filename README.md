### Load unpacked chrome extension
To test the extension go to chrome, and load the extension from the extenstions manage page as unpacked.

The boilerplate is made up of a vue application for each of the main chrome scripts. To edit the popup for example look in the src/popup/popup.vue file to make changes.
